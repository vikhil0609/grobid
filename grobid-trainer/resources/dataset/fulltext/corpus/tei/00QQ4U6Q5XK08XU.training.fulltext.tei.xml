			<p>The present petition has been filed by the petitioner praying inter<lb/> alia for issuing a writ of mandamus directing the respondent<lb/></p>

			<p>No.1/Registrar Cooperative Societies (RCS) to consider and dispose of<lb/> his representation filed under Section 77 of Delhi Cooperative Societies<lb/> Act (DCS Act) and for directing the respondent No.2 to allot him a<lb/> Category &apos;A&apos; flat in Saraswati Cooperative Group Housing Society Ltd.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.<lb/></head>

			<p>Learned counsel for the petitioner states that the petitioner became<lb/> a member of the respondent No.2/Society on 30.01.1991. The petition<lb/> refers to the fact that the petitioner had deposited a sum of Rs.9,00,000/-<lb/>with the Respondent No.2/Society between year 1991 and 2000. Though<lb/> there is not a whisper in the petition as to the background in which his<lb/> membership was initially cancelled, he has averred that his membership<lb/> was restored in the Arbitration proceedings.<lb/></p>

			<figure>3.<lb/> It is the version of the Respondent No.2/Society that the petitioner<lb/> had tendered his resignation from the Society in the year 1998, which is<lb/> disputed by the counsel for the petitioner. However, he is not in position<lb/> to explain the circumstances in which the membership of the petitioner<lb/> was terminated and then restored. The next relevant date mentioned in<lb/> the petition is 28.01.2016, when the petitioner claims to have filed a RTI<lb/> application before the respondent No.1/RCS for obtaining information<lb/> with regard to the details of the Administrator appointed in respect of the<lb/> respondent No.2/Society.<lb/> 4.<lb/> It is not disputed by learned counsel for the petitioner that the<lb/> proceedings filed by the petitioner before the RCS under Section 77 of<lb/> DCS Act are pending adjudication. Without awaiting closure of the said<lb/> proceedings, he has approached this Court for seeking direction to the<lb/> respondent no.1/RCS for disposing of a representation made by him.<lb/></figure>

			<p>5.<lb/> On 08.12.2016, learned counsel for the respondent No.1/RCS had<lb/> stated that the submissions made by the petitioner in the present petition<lb/> would be considered and appropriate order issued.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.<lb/></head>

			<p>Learned counsel for the respondent No.1 states that he has also<lb/> filed a status report on 09.02.2017, in compliance of the order dated<lb/> 08.12.2016 wherein it has been submitted that despite repeated<lb/> opportunities given to the petitioner to produce the original records<lb/> pertaining to his membership and the payments allegedly deposited by<lb/> him with the respondent No.2/Society, from time to time, no document<lb/> whatsoever has been furnished by him to substantiate the same.<lb/></p>

			<figure>7.<lb/> At this, learned counsel for the petitioner hands over a letter dated<lb/> 11.04.2017, addressed by the respondent No.1/RCS to the respondent<lb/> No.2/Society calling upon it to furnish certain documents as detailed<lb/> therein so that the petitioner&apos;s representation can be considered and<lb/> decided.<lb/> 8.<lb/> Learned counsel for the respondent No.2/Society states that an<lb/> Administrator was appointed in respect of the respondent No.2/Society,<lb/> somewhere in the year 2006 and he has handed over the charge to the<lb/> newly elected Managing Committee of the Society only on 19.02.2017.<lb/> The documents required to be furnished by the Society are being traced<lb/> for being placed before the respondent No.1/RCS. He states that such of<lb/> the documents that are traceable, shall be forwarded within two weeks.<lb/> 9.<lb/> In view of the submissions made by learned counsel for the<lb/> respondent No.2/Society as recorded above, the present petition is<lb/> disposed of with a direction to the respondent no.1/RCS to examine the<lb/> documents furnished by the Society and take a decision on the pending<lb/> application of the petitioner within 8 weeks from the date of receipt of the<lb/> documents, under written intimation to him.<lb/> 10. The petition is disposed of.<lb/> HIMA KOHLI, J<lb/> SANGITA DHINGRA SEHGAL, J<lb/> MAY 01, 2017<lb/> afa</figure>
