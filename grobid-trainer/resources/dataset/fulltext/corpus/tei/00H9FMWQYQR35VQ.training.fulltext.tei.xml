			<p>This is an application for seeking condonation of delay in filing<lb/> the reply.<lb/></p>

			<p>1.1 The period of delay is 13 days.<lb/></p>

			<p>1.2 For the reasons given in the application, the delay is condoned.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.<lb/></head>

			<p>The Registry will place the reply on record.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.<lb/></head>

			<p>The application is, accordingly, disposed of.<lb/></p>

			<head>ARB.P. 545/2018<lb/></head>

			<p>4.<lb/> Notice in this petition was issued on 31.7.2018 which was made<lb/> returnable on 10.10.2018.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.1 On 10.10.2018, learned counsel for the respondent was granted<lb/> ten (10) days to file a reply.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.2 As noted hereinabove, the reply is under objection and not on<lb/> record.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.3 The reason, perhaps, was that the reply was filed beyond the<lb/> period allocated by this Court vide order dated 10.10.2018. However,<lb/> counsel for the respondent, on being queried, says that the respondent&apos;s<lb/> principal objection to the arbitration petition is that the claim which is<lb/> sought to be placed before the Arbitral Tribunal is barred by limitation.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.4 Learned counsel for the respondent, however, says that there is no<lb/> dispute as regards the existence of an arbitration agreement.<lb/></p>

			<head>5<lb/></head>

			<p>I may only note that counsel for the petitioner says that the claim<lb/> is within the period of limitation.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.1 This argument is articulated on the basis that the agreement<lb/> between the parties was executed on 14.6.2013, whereupon, supplies of<lb/> paddy and lentils were made.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.2</head>

			<p>The claim of the petitioner emanates from the alleged withholding<lb/> of amounts against the supplies made.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.3 It is the petitioner&apos;s case that the respondent has wrongly withheld<lb/> a sum of Rs.59,60,127.50.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.<lb/></head>

			<p>The petitioner further avers that several request letters were<lb/> served on the respondent. This being letters dated 16.4.2015, 2.9.2015<lb/> and 30.5.2016.<lb/></p>

			<head>7.<lb/></head>

			<p>The petitioner also claims that since a notice dated 10.6.2016<lb/> triggering the arbitration agreement was served on the respondent and,<lb/> therefore the claim is within limitation.<lb/></p>

			<head>8.<lb/></head>

			<p>Learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, raises<lb/> objections on the ground that since the instant petition was filed on<lb/> 2.6.2018, the claim is barred by limitation.<lb/></p>

			<p>8.1 According to me, prima facie, this submission is unsustainable.<lb/></p>

			<head>9.<lb/></head>

			<p>However, given the fact that there is no dispute as to the existence<lb/> of an arbitration agreement, I am inclined to allow the prayer.<lb/></p>

			<p>10. Accordingly, Ms. Ravinder Kaur, (Cell no.:9910384660), former<lb/></p>

			<p>District &amp; Sessions Judge, is appointed as the Arbitrator.<lb/></p>

			<p>11. Since both the counsel are agreed that the arbitration proceedings<lb/> should be held under the aegis of the Delhi International Arbitration<lb/> Centre (in short &apos;Centre&apos;), it is ordered accordingly.<lb/></p>

			<p>11.1 Consequently, the rules and the fee schedule of the Centre would<lb/> apply in this case.<lb/></p>

			<p>12. The petition is disposed of in the aforesaid terms.<lb/></p>

			<p>13. The Registry is directed to despatch a copy of this order to the<lb/> Co-ordinator, DIAC and the learned Arbitrator.<lb/></p>
