			<front>W.P. (C ) 2241/2018 <lb/>Page 1 of 4 <lb/>#39 <lb/>IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI <lb/>Judgment delivered on: 27 th September, 2018 <lb/>W.P.(C) 2241/2018 <lb/>M/S TARA CHAND SUMIT CONST. CO. <lb/>..... Petitioner <lb/>versus <lb/>DELHI DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY <lb/>..... Respondent <lb/>Advocates who appeared in this case: <lb/>For the Petitioner <lb/>: Ms. Stuti Jain and Mr. Akshu Jain, Advocates. <lb/>For the Respondent <lb/>: Ms. Kanika Singh and Mr. Sangram Singh, Advocates <lb/>for DDA. <lb/>CORAM: <lb/>HON&apos;BLE MR. JUSTICE SIDDHARTH MRIDUL <lb/>J U D G M E N T <lb/>SIDDHARTH MRIDUL, J (ORAL) <lb/></front>

			<body>1. <lb/>Petitioner is aggrieved by the order No.92/2017 dated 13.9.2017 <lb/>passed by the Contractor&apos;s Registration Board, whereby, the petitioner, who <lb/>is a contractor of the respondent, has been debarred from tendering further <lb/>for tenders issued by the DDA for a period of three years from the date of <lb/>issuance of the impugned order. The said order has been passed pursuant to a <lb/>show cause notice dated 19.7.2017 issued to the petitioner, which reads as <lb/>under : <lb/></body>

			<body>&quot;It has been intimated to this office by CE(Dwarka)/DDA <lb/>regarding subject cited above. It is informed that the Agency <lb/>habitually litigious in nature and have indulged in many <lb/>litigations/arbitration with the Department which is violation of <lb/>Clause 23.1 (C) of Enlistment Rule as well as Agency is <lb/>habitually in making baseless allegations against officials of <lb/>DDA and finding slackness in commencement of work after <lb/>award. <lb/>Therefore, I served up to you to Show Cause why <lb/>disciplinary action as laid down Under Rule 23 of The <lb/>Enlistment Rule of DDA should not taken against you. <lb/>Your reply should reach this office within 15 days from <lb/>the date of issue of this letter, If No reply is received from you or <lb/>the reply is not found satisfactorily, action as deem fit shall be <lb/>taken against you without further notice.&quot; <lb/>2. <lb/>While the show cause notice by itself does not elaborate/give the basis <lb/>to form an opinion for the petitioner being habitual in making baseless <lb/>allegations and his slackness in commencement of work after award, the <lb/>impugned order by itself, is a non-speaking order. As per the averments <lb/>made in the petition, which are supported by an affidavit, the petitioner had <lb/>responded to the show cause notice and given a reply running into almost ten <lb/>pages, but, the impugned order cryptically disposed it off vide the impugned <lb/>order. <lb/>3. <lb/>In (2014) 9 SCC 105 Gorkha Security Services vs. Government <lb/>(NCT of Delhi) and Others, it has come to be held, as under : <lb/></body>

			<body>&quot;21) The Central issue, however, pertains to the requirement <lb/>of stating the action which is proposed to be taken. The <lb/>fundamental purpose behind the serving of Show Cause Notice <lb/>is to make the noticee understand the precise case set up against <lb/>him which he has to meet. This would require the statement of <lb/>imputations detailing out the alleged breaches and defaults he <lb/>has committed, so that he gets an opportunity to rebut the same. <lb/>Another requirement, according to us, is the nature of action <lb/>which is proposed to be taken for such a breach. That should <lb/>also be stated so that the noticee is able to point out that <lb/>proposed action is not warranted in the given case, even if the <lb/>defaults/ breaches complained of are not satisfactorily <lb/>explained. When it comes to black listing, this requirement <lb/>becomes all the more imperative, having regard to the fact that <lb/>it is harshest possible action. <lb/>22) The High Court has simply stated that the purpose of <lb/>show cause notice is primarily to enable the noticee to meet the <lb/>grounds on which the action is proposed against him. No doubt, <lb/>the High Court is justified to this extent. However, it is equally <lb/>important to mention as to what would be the consequence if the <lb/>noticee does not satisfactorily meet the grounds on which an <lb/>action is proposed. To put it otherwise, we are of the opinion <lb/>that in order to fulfil the requirements of principles of natural <lb/>justice, a show cause notice should meet the following two <lb/>requirements viz: <lb/>i) <lb/>The material/ grounds to be stated on which according to <lb/>the Department necessitates an action; <lb/>ii) <lb/>Particular penalty/action which is proposed to be taken. <lb/>It is this second requirement which the High Court has failed to <lb/>omit. <lb/></body>

			<body>we may hasten to add that even if it is not specifically <lb/>mentioned in the show cause notice but it can be clearly and <lb/>safely be discerned from the reading thereof, that would be <lb/>sufficient to meet this requirement.&quot; <lb/>4. <lb/>In view of the ratio of the judgment (supra), show cause notice dated <lb/>19.7.2017 and the impugned order No.92/2017 dated 13.9.2017 are set aside. <lb/>Liberty is however, reserved to the respondent-DDA to issue fresh show <lb/>cause intimating the reasons to form an opinion for the issuance of the show <lb/>cause notice for debarment/blacklisting and then, pass a speaking order, <lb/>having given an opportunity of reply and personal hearing, if, called for. <lb/>5. <lb/>The petition is disposed off accordingly. <lb/>Dasti. <lb/>SIDDHARTH MRIDUL <lb/>(JUDGE) <lb/>SEPTEMBER 27, 2018 <lb/>RS </body>
