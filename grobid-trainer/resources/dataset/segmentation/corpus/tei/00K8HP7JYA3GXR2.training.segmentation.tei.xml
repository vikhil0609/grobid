			<body>the Senior Civil Judge (South) at Saket Courts, New Delhi in the <lb/>course of proceedings arising out of the civil suit, presently <lb/>registered as CS no. SCJ 82862/16, which was originally instituted <lb/>by the petitioner on 06.11.1989, whereby the application under <lb/>Order I Rule 10 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 (CPC) of the <lb/>tenth respondent, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) was <lb/>allowed and it was impleaded as tenth defendant. <lb/>2. <lb/>It may be noted at the outset that the civil suit, which has been <lb/>pending since 1989, concerns a plot of land described by the <lb/>petitioner (plaintiff) as Lal Masjid Qabristan in Khasra no. 389, <lb/>360 and 361 within revenue record of the village, Aliganj, Lala <lb/>Lajpatrai Marg, New Delhi, the prayer in the civil suit being for a <lb/>decree for permanent injunction against interference in the peaceful <lb/>possession and enjoyment thereof or from committing trespass into <lb/>it or against putting any malba into it or causing any damage and <lb/>demolition to the graveyard and the property or leveling any <lb/>portion by the parties in the case arrayed as defendants. <lb/>3. <lb/>The array of defendants in the suit, as originally presented by <lb/>the petitioner, included Union Of India through its Secretary in the <lb/>Ministry of Home Affairs (first defendant); Delhi Administration <lb/>through its Chief Secretary now Government of NCT of Delhi <lb/>(second defendant); Central Public Works Department (CPWD) <lb/>through its Chief Engineer (third defendant); Land and <lb/>Development Officer (fourth defendant); Delhi Development <lb/>Authority (fifth defendant); Municipal Corporation of Delhi (sixth <lb/>defendant); the Commissioner of Police New Delhi (seventh <lb/></body>

			<body>defendant); Station House Officer of Police Station Lodhi Colony <lb/>(eighth defendant); and New Delhi Municipal Committee (ninth <lb/>defendant). It may also be noted here that the defendants, <lb/>particularly the Union of India in the course of contest, have taken <lb/>the position that suit property is government land and that the <lb/>plaintiff is an unauthorized and illegal occupier of the same. <lb/>4. <lb/>It is stated that the Land and Development Officer of <lb/>Government of India (fourth defendant in the suit) had originally <lb/>earmarked the land in question to CPWD (third defendant) but, by <lb/>letter dated 28.02.2017, it has allotted land admeasuring 2.23 <lb/>acres, to CRPF for construction of its office accommodation, <lb/>shifting of Canteen, barracks for men and parking of vehicles etc. <lb/>5. <lb/>It is against the aforesaid backdrop that the application under <lb/>Order I Rule 10 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908(CPC) was <lb/>moved before the Senior Civil Judge on 29.04.2017 by the Senior <lb/>Central Government Counsel seeking impleadment of CRPF (to be <lb/>represented through its Director General) as one of the defendants. <lb/>The application was contested by the petitioner/plaintiff, as noticed <lb/>in the order, by pleadings to the effect that such impleadment was <lb/>not necessary inter alia because it was in breach of the doctrine of <lb/>lis-pendens under Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 <lb/>and that such move is belated and would delay the trial. The Trial <lb/>Judge has found such objections to be devoid of substance and <lb/>found it appropriate to implead CRPF as an additional defendant. <lb/>6. <lb/>The petition is pressed to challenge the above mentioned order <lb/>on the same very contentions as were urged before the learned trial <lb/></body>

			<div type="annex">judge. Reliance is placed on decisions of learned single judges of <lb/>this court in Sanjay Gupta Vs. Smt. Kala Wati 85 (2000) DLT 828, <lb/>Prakash Khattar Vs. Shanta Jindal &amp; Ors. 181 (2011) DLT 138 <lb/>and Bhim Singh Vs. Amar Nath &amp; Ors. 149 (2008) DLT 34 to <lb/>submit that the allotment in favour of the CRPF was in breach of <lb/>the doctrine of lis-pendens as per Section 52 of the Transfer of <lb/>Property Act, 1882. It is also argued that the impleadment of a <lb/>party against the stand taken by the plaintiff is permitted only if <lb/>there is a legal right vesting in such additional party making him a <lb/>necessary party within the meaning of the provision contained in <lb/>Order I Rule 10 CPC. <lb/>7. <lb/>Having heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and learned <lb/>counsel representing the respondents, this Court finds no merit in <lb/>the petition. The view taken by the learned trial judge in the <lb/>impugned order does not call for any interference. The validity of <lb/>allotment in favour of CRPF cannot be questioned or determined <lb/>without the party in question (the allottee) being arrayed as <lb/>defendant. By such allotment, CRPF claims to have acquired a <lb/>vested interest. In these circumstances, it is not merely a proper <lb/>party, but a necessary party to the proceedings. <lb/>8. <lb/>The petition is, therefore, dismissed. <lb/>R.K.GAUBA, J. <lb/>NOVEMBER 15, 2017/umang </div>
