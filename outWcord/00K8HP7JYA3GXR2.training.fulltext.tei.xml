			<p>the Senior Civil Judge (South) at Saket Courts, New Delhi in the<lb/> course of proceedings arising out of the civil suit, presently<lb/> registered as CS no. SCJ 82862/16, which was originally instituted<lb/> by the petitioner on 06.11.1989, whereby the application under<lb/> Order I Rule 10 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 (CPC) of the<lb/> tenth respondent, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) was<lb/> allowed and it was impleaded as tenth defendant.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.<lb/></head>

			<p>It may be noted at the outset that the civil suit, which has been<lb/> pending since 1989, concerns a plot of land described by the<lb/> petitioner (plaintiff) as Lal Masjid Qabristan in Khasra no. 389,<lb/> 360 and 361 within revenue record of the village, Aliganj, Lala<lb/> Lajpatrai Marg, New Delhi, the prayer in the civil suit being for a<lb/> decree for permanent injunction against interference in the peaceful<lb/> possession and enjoyment thereof or from committing trespass into<lb/> it or against putting any malba into it or causing any damage and<lb/> demolition to the graveyard and the property or leveling any<lb/> portion by the parties in the case arrayed as defendants.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.<lb/></head>

			<p>The array of defendants in the suit, as originally presented by<lb/> the petitioner, included Union Of India through its Secretary in the<lb/></p>

			<figure>Ministry of Home Affairs (first defendant); Delhi Administration<lb/> through its Chief Secretary now Government of NCT of Delhi<lb/> (second defendant); Central Public Works Department (CPWD)<lb/> through its Chief Engineer (third defendant); Land and<lb/> Development Officer (fourth defendant); Delhi Development<lb/> Authority (fifth defendant); Municipal Corporation of Delhi (sixth<lb/> defendant); the Commissioner of Police New Delhi (seventh<lb/> defendant); Station House Officer of Police Station Lodhi Colony<lb/> (eighth defendant); and New Delhi Municipal Committee (ninth<lb/> defendant). It may also be noted here that the defendants,<lb/> particularly the Union of India in the course of contest, have taken<lb/> the position that suit property is government land and that the<lb/> plaintiff is an unauthorized and illegal occupier of the same.<lb/> 4.<lb/> It is stated that the Land and Development Officer of<lb/> Government of India (fourth defendant in the suit) had originally<lb/> earmarked the land in question to CPWD (third defendant) but, by<lb/> letter dated 28.02.2017, it has allotted land admeasuring 2.23<lb/> acres, to CRPF for construction of its office accommodation,<lb/> shifting of Canteen, barracks for men and parking of vehicles etc.<lb/> 5.<lb/> It is against the aforesaid backdrop that the application under<lb/> Order I Rule 10 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908(CPC) was<lb/> moved before the Senior Civil Judge on 29.04.2017 by the Senior<lb/> Central Government Counsel seeking impleadment of CRPF (to be<lb/> represented through its Director General) as one of the defendants.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The application was contested by the petitioner/plaintiff, as noticed<lb/> in the order, by pleadings to the effect that such impleadment was<lb/> not necessary inter alia because it was in breach of the doctrine of<lb/> lis-pendens under Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882<lb/></p>

			<p>and that such move is belated and would delay the trial. The Trial<lb/> Judge has found such objections to be devoid of substance and<lb/> found it appropriate to implead CRPF as an additional defendant.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.<lb/></head>

			<p>The petition is pressed to challenge the above mentioned order<lb/> on the same very contentions as were urged before the learned trial</p>
