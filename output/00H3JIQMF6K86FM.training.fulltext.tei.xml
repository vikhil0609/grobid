			<p>below; of the Trial Court dated 13.4.2015 and the First Appellate Court dated<lb/> 3.5.2016; by which the courts below have decreed the suit filed by the<lb/> respondent/plaintiff for permanent and mandatory injunction. Operative<lb/> paragraph 30 of the judgment of the trial court decreeing the suit reads as<lb/> under:-<lb/>&quot;In the light of discussion hereinabove, suit of the plaintiff is decreed. The<lb/> defendant is hereby restrained from constructing any staircases at the back<lb/> portion of the property bearing no. 277/7, Ground Floor, Pul Prahaladpur, New<lb/> Delhi. The defendant is also hereby restrained from blocking and locking the<lb/> common passage entrance gate and bathroom at the ground floor of the above<lb/> said property. The defendant is further restrained from creating any hindrance<lb/> in the use of common passage and bath room by the plaintiff in any manner on<lb/> the ground floor of the above said property. The defendant is also decreed to<lb/> remove the goods kept by him in the common passage at the ground floor of<lb/> the above said property. In the circumstances of the case, no order for cost.<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">Parties shall bear their own cost.&quot;<lb/> (underlining added)<lb/> 2.<lb/> The case of the respondent/plaintiff was that she purchased the<lb/> basement/lower ground floor of the property bearing No. 277/7, Pul<lb/> Prahaladpur, New Delhi, as per documentation dated 26.10.2005 from Sh.<lb/> Kuljeet Singh. The title documents included registered General Power of<lb/> Attorney, agreement to sell, affidavit etc. By these documents proved as<lb/> Ex.PW1/16 (colly) before the trial court, respondent/plaintiff purchased rights in<lb/></figure>

			<p>the suit property along with common passage for approach, staircase etc. The<lb/> respondent/plaintiff was enjoying the common passage, staircase and bathroom<lb/> on the ground floor since the date of purchase of the suit property and the<lb/> respondent/plaintiff had installed entrance gate and the door at the back portion<lb/> of the common passage with the joint funds with other shopkeepers for safety<lb/> purpose. Electricity meter of the respondent/plaintiff was also installed at the<lb/> common passage of the ground floor of the suit property. That the<lb/> appellant/defendant has wilfully and illegally blocked the common passage by<lb/> keeping his almirah and table and he also has locked the bathroom.<lb/></p>

			<p>Appellant/defendant was seeking to create hindrance in the use of the common<lb/> passage, and also the bathroom and was trying to illegally put locks at the<lb/> ground floor of the suit property. Appellant/defendant was also illegally trying<lb/> to build the staircase on the back portion of the suit property, therefore, closing<lb/> the door of the back portion as well as the window of the basement property of<lb/> the respondent/plaintiff.<lb/> he subject suit hence was filed by the<lb/> respondent/plaintiff with the following prayers:-<lb/>&quot;(a) pass a decree of permanent injunction in favour of the plaintiff by<lb/> restraining the defendants, their agents, associates, legal heirs etc. from<lb/> constructing the staircase at back portion of the said property and blocking and<lb/> locking the common passage entrance gate and bathroom at the ground floor of<lb/> the suit property and not to interfere in the use of common passage and<lb/> bathroom by the plaintiff in any manner.<lb/></p>

			<p>(b) Pass a decree of mandatory injunction in favour of the plaintiff and against<lb/> the defendant by removing the goods kept by the defendant in the common<lb/> passage at the ground floor.<lb/></p>

			<p>(c) Cost of the suit be awarded in favour of the plaintiff and against the<lb/> defendant.<lb/></p>

			<p>(d) Any other relief (s) this Hon&quot;ble Court may deems fit and proper in the<lb/> facts and circumstances in the present case.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<head>3.<lb/></head>

			<p>Appellant/defendant filed his written statement and denied the<lb/> rights of the respondent/plaintiff in the common passage or the bathroom or in<lb/> the back portion. It was pleaded that the respondent/plaintiff had no rights in<lb/> the common passage or the back portion or the bathroom of the ground floor of<lb/> the property.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.<lb/></head>

			<p>After pleadings were completed, the trial court on 12.9.2011 framed the<lb/> following issues:-<lb/>&quot;(1) Whether the suit is bad for mis-joinder on necessary parties? OPD<lb/></p>

			<p>(2) Whether the suit is barred by delay and latches? OPD<lb/></p>

			<p>(3) Whether the plaintiff has not approached the Court with clean<lb/> hand? OPD<lb/> (4) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to a decree of permanent injunction as<lb/> prayed for in prayer clause (a) of the plaint? OPD<lb/></p>

			<p>(5) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to a decree of mandatory injunction as<lb/> prayed for in prayer clause (b) of the plaint? OPD<lb/> exhibited as Ex. PW2/A (colly-16 pages).<lb/></p>

			<p>(8) PE was closed vide order dated 31.07.2013. The defendant did not lead any<lb/> evidence. DE was closed vide order dated 22.08.2013.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<head>6.<lb/></head>

			<p>The courts below have held that respondent/plaintiff by means of her<lb/> title documents Ex.PW1/16 (colly) has proved that respondent/plaintiff<lb/> purchased besides the basement/lower ground floor, right in the common<lb/> passage, staircase etc, and therefore, respondent/plaintiff had rights to use the<lb/> common passage, bathroom on the ground floor as also prevent the<lb/> appellant/defendant from closing the back door and construct the staircase at the<lb/> back.<lb/></p>

			<head>7.<lb/></head>

			<p>In my opinion, no substantial question of law arises under Section<lb/> 100 CPC for setting aside of the concurrent judgments of courts below<lb/> inasmuch as whereas the respondent/plaintiff proved her case by leading<lb/> evidence, the appellant/defendant admittedly led no evidence.<lb/></p>

			<head>8.<lb/></head>

			<p>As also stated above, the title documents of the<lb/> respondent/plaintiff, Ex.PW1/16 (colly) duly show right of the<lb/> respondent/plaintiff besides to the basement also to the staircase and common<lb/> passage etc. The only way this evidence could be displaced was by leading of<lb/> evidence by the appellant/defendant with respect to whether he was the<lb/> exclusive owner of the common passage on the ground floor, bathroom on the<lb/> ground floor as also the back portion area for construction of the staircase, but<lb/> since appellant/defendant led no evidence, appellant/defendant cannot be said to<lb/> have proved his case of his ownership of the common passage, bathroom, back<lb/> portion etc.<lb/></p>

			<head>9.<lb/></head>

			<p>Learned counsel for the appellant/defendant argued that<lb/> appellant/defendant had moved an application before the first appellate court for<lb/> leading additional evidence under Order XLI Rule 27 CPC, but this application<lb/> was illegally not decided by the first appellate court, however I note that right to<lb/> lead additional evidence under Order XLI Rule 27 CPC is only if there is<lb/> already some evidence of a person and additional evidence is sought to be led<lb/> on complying with the ingredients of Order XLI Rule 27 CPC. However, once<lb/> evidence of a person is closed because evidence is not led in spite of sufficient<lb/> opportunities, then in such a case, the provision of Order XLI Rule 27 CPC<lb/> cannot be invoked.<lb/></p>

			<p>10.<lb/> I must finally note that even before this Court in spite of<lb/> opportunities, appellant/defendant did not file copies of his title documents to<lb/> show that he was the exclusive owner of the ground floor, common passage,<lb/> bathroom on the ground floor or the back portion of the property.<lb/></p>

			<head>11.<lb/></head>

			<p>In view of the above, there is no merit in this Regular Second<lb/></p>

			<p>Appeal and the same is therefore dismissed as no sufficient question of law<lb/> arises.<lb/></p>
