			<p>1.<lb/></p>

			<p>Impugned order of 16 th October, 2017 (Annexure P-1) rejects<lb/> petitioner&apos;s application for allotment of alternate plot in lieu of acquired<lb/> land on the ground that the following requisite documents have not been<lb/> furnished:-<lb/></p>

				<formula>(i). Affidavit<lb/> (ii). Complete revenue record<lb/> (iii). Ownership status<lb/> (iv). R.D.(Relinquishment Deed)<lb/> 2.<lb/></formula>

			<p>Counsel for petitioner submits that on the last date of hearing, copy<lb/> of Minutes of Meeting of the Recommendation Committee held on 17 th<lb/> September, 2014 was handed over to respondents&apos; counsel to clarify as to<lb/> how the impugned order can be justified, as the Recommendation<lb/> Committee had recommended the case of petitioner for allotment of<lb/> alternate plot way back in the year 2014.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.<lb/></head>

			<p>On behalf of respondent, it is maintained that the requisite<lb/> documents, as afore-noted, have not been supplied and therefore, the<lb/> competent authority has rejected the case of petitioner. On the other hand,<lb/> petitioner&apos;s counsel maintains that aforesaid documents were appended to<lb/> the application seeking allotment of alternate plot.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.<lb/></head>

			<p>Without going into this aspect any further, it is deemed appropriate<lb/> to dispose of this petition with direction to respondent to reconsider<lb/> petitioner&apos;s application (Annexure P-3) after the aforesaid documents are<lb/> supplied by petitioner within three weeks from today. Upon receipt of<lb/> such documents, petitioner&apos;s application (Annexure P-3) be considered<lb/> by respondent within twelve weeks and its fate be made known to<lb/> petitioner within three weeks thereafter, so that petitioner may avail of the<lb/> remedies, as available in law, if need be.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.<lb/></head>

			<p>With aforesaid directions, this petition is disposed of.<lb/></p>
