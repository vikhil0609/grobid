			<body>O R D E R <lb/>(ORAL) <lb/>1. <lb/>In the above captioned first petition, quashing of FIR No.150/2012, <lb/>whereas in the above captioned second petition, quashing of FIR <lb/>No.131/2012, both registered at police station Sarojini Nagar, New Delhi <lb/>is sought. Both the FIRs arise out of one common incident. In FIR <lb/>No.150/2012, petitioners Om Prakash and others have been put on trial <lb/>for the offence under Section 325/34 IPC and in FIR No. 131/2012, <lb/>petitioners Rakesh @ Banti and others have been put on trial for offences <lb/>under Sections 325/506/34 IPC. Quashing of these FIRs is sought on the <lb/>ground that the misunderstanding which led to this incident, now stands <lb/>cleared between the parties. <lb/>2. <lb/>Mr.M.P.Singh, Additional Public Prosecutor for respondent-State, <lb/>accepts notice in FIR No.131/2012 and submits that Om Prakash Lamba, <lb/>who is complainant of this FIR, is present in the Court. Ms. Neelam <lb/>Sharma, Additional Public Prosecutor for respondent-State in FIR <lb/>No.150/2012 accepts notice and submits that Rachit Kansal and Mr. <lb/>Rakesh @ Bunti, who are complaints of this FIR, are present in the Court. <lb/>SI Shiv Kumar, who is the Investigating Officer of these FIRs, has <lb/>identified the private respondents present in the Court as complainants of <lb/>these two FIRs. <lb/>3. <lb/>With the consent of learned counsel for the parties, both these <lb/>petitions have been heard together and are being disposed of by this <lb/>common order. <lb/>4. <lb/>Complainants of these cross FIRs submit that the <lb/>misunderstanding, which led to registration of cross FIRs, now stands <lb/></body>

			<body>cleared and they stand by the affidavits filed in support of these petitions. <lb/>They submit both the sides are neighbours and to restore harmony <lb/>between the parties, proceedings arising out of these two FIRs be brought <lb/>to an end. <lb/>5. <lb/>In &quot;Gian Singh Vs. State of Punjab&quot; (2012) 10 SCC 303 Apex <lb/>Court has recognized the need of amicable resolution of disputes in cases <lb/>like the instant one, by observing as under:-<lb/>&quot;61. In other words, the High Court must consider <lb/>whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice <lb/>to continue with the criminal proceedings or continuation of <lb/>criminal proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of <lb/>law despite settlement and compromise between the victim and <lb/>the wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is <lb/>appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if the <lb/>answer to the above question(s) is in the affirmative, the High <lb/>Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal <lb/>proceedings.&quot; <lb/>7. <lb/>The aforesaid dictum stands reiterated by the Apex Court in a <lb/>recent judgment in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab (2014) 6 SCC 466. <lb/>8. <lb/>In view of the fact that the incident in question, which led to <lb/>lodging of these two FIRs, took place on a trivial issue and the <lb/>misunderstanding amongst the parties now stands cleared, this Court <lb/>finds that continuance of proceedings arising out of these cross FIRs <lb/>would be an exercise in futility. <lb/>9. <lb/>Accordingly, the proceedings arising out of FIR No.150/2012 and <lb/>FIR No.131/2012, both registered at police station Sarojini Nagar, New <lb/>Delhi shall stand quashed, subject to deposit of cost of â‚¹10,000/-each in <lb/></body>
