# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [0.7.0] – 2021-07-17

### Added

+ New YAML configuration: all the settings are in one single yaml file, each model can be fully configured independently

+ Add figure and table pop-up visualization on PDF in the console demo
+ Add PDF MD5 digest in the TEI results (service only)
+ Language support packages and xpdfrc file for pdfalto (support of CJK and exotic fonts)
+ Prometheus metrics 
+ BidLSTM-CRF-FEATURES implementation available for more models
+ Addition of a "How GROBID works" page in the documentation

### Changed

+ JitPack release (RIP jcenter)
+ Improved DOI cleaning 
+ Speed improvement (around +10%), by factorizing some layout token manipulation
+ Update CrossRef requests implementation to align to the current usage of CrossRef's `X-Rate-Limit-Limit` response parameter

## [0.6.2] – 2021-03-20

### Added

+ Docker image covering both Deep Learning and CRF models, with GPU detection and preloading of embeddings
+ For Deep Learning models, labeling is now done by batch: application of the citation DL model is 4 times faster for BidLSTM-CRF (with or without features) and 6 times faster for SciBERT
+ More tests for sentence segmentation
+ Add orcid of persons when available from the PDF or via consolidation (i.e. if in CrossRef metadata) 
+ Add BidLSTM-CRF-FEATURES header model (with feature channel)
+ Add bioRxiv end-to-end evaluation
+ Bounding boxes for optional section titles coordinates

### Changed

+ Reduce the size of docker images

+ Update of several models covering CRF, BidLSTM-CRF and BidLSTM-CRF-FEATURES, mainly improving citation and author recognitions
+ OpenNLP is the default optional sentence segmenter (similar result as Pragmatic Segmenter for scholar documents after benchmarking, but 30 times faster)
+ Refine sentence segmentation to exploit layout information and predicted reference callouts
+ Update jep version to 3.9.1

### Fixed

+ Ignore invalid utf-8 sequences
+ Update CrossRef multithreaded calls to avoid using the unreliable time interval returned by the CrossRef REST API service, update usage of `Crossref-Plus-API-Token` and update the deprecated crossref field `query.title`
